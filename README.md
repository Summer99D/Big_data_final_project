## TO future labs hiring team: 

This is a final project for the Big data class at Booth school of business. throughout this group project we worked on seperate tasks to identify the underlying factors of COVID-19 in different US counties. 

this project was done in R mostly, and we used an array of libraries and packagaes including, but not limited to:

### Data Manipulation & Wrangling
- `dplyr` – Tools for data manipulation (also included in `tidyverse`)
- `tidyverse` – Meta-package including `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `tidyr`, `readr`, `purrr`, `tibble`, `stringr`, and `forcats`
- `Matrix` – Efficient handling of sparse and dense matrices
- `readxl` – Read Excel files (.xls, .xlsx)

### Visualization
- `ggplot2` – Data visualization using the grammar of graphics
- `rpart.plot` – Plotting recursive partitioning trees

### Modeling & Analysis
- `gamlr` – Generalized additive models with regularization
- `rpart` – Recursive partitioning and regression trees
- `randomForest` – Random forest models for classification and regression

### Utilities
- `parallel` – Parallel computing and multicore processing
- `xtable` – Convert R objects to LaTeX or HTML tables

the PDF file might seem long but it is because all the under-hood coding has been attached to the end of it. for convenience, I have added a shorter snippet of the coding ppart one of my teammates and I did so that you can see it. 

the final document was woven in overleaf.
