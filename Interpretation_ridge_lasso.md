From the cross-validation (CV) error vs. lambda plots, we can see that:

The Ridge CV error initially decreases with λ, but starts increasing sharply beyond the optimal λ (~10.72). This suggests too much regularization degrades model performance.
The Lasso CV error behaves similarly, reaching the lowest error around λ = 0.285 before increasing.

General Observations:
Training MSE: Ridge Regression has a slightly lower MSE on the training set compared to Lasso, suggesting it fits
the training data marginally better.
Testing MSE: Lasso Regression performs slightly better on the test set, indicating a marginally better
generalization compared to Ridge.
Model Performance: The differences in MSE between the models are relatively minor. Lasso offers slightly better
generalization based on the test MSE, but the difference is marginal.
Model Interpretability: Lasso has the advantage of potentially providing a sparser solution, meaning it could zero
out some coefficients entirely. This could be beneficial if interpretability is a key factor, as it simplifies the model
by effectively selecting features.
The final recommendation to the CDC would lean towards Lasso due to its slightly better generalization
capability in this particular scenario and its added benefit of interpretability by feature selection.
