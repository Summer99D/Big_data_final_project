```{r}
### playlist df
##just looking at statistical
summary(playlist_df)
#looking at columns
colnames(playlist_df)
```

```{r}
##creating a boxplot of num_tracks column to see how many tracks are there in average
# Create a boxplot
# Create the boxplot
ggplot(playlist_df) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = "number of samples", y = num_samples), width = 0.2) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = "number of tracks", y = num_tracks), width = 0.2) +
  labs(title = "Boxplots of num_samples and num_tracks", x = "Category", y = "Values") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(hjust = 1))
```
there is a large number of variables where the number of samples is too small. we don't want that so we create a subset where number of samples is mean or larger!

```{r}
